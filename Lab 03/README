Lab 03: "Huffman Encoding"
April 24, 2018


This application encodes or decodes files using Huffman Encoding.

Please see the PDF file in the project directory, 
"LabHuffmanEncoding v2.pdf", for detail 
about the lab assignment.  Also, the analysis file
"AdamRich_Lab03_Analysis.pdf".


Output of "java -version" on the DEV machine

  java version "1.8.0_161"
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_161-b12)
  Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.161-b12, mixed mode, sharing)

This version of Java is also known as "Java 8.0 SE"


No IDE was used; this code was written in Notepad++ and 
compiled from the command line.

For an example of how to compile, please see "rebuild.bat".

  @echo off
  javac src\*.java

Here is an example of how to run the application, 
new lines added for readability.

  java -cp src\ Lab03 
    input\freq-backward.txt
    input\clear-given.txt
    output\given-encoded-backward.txt   
    e   
    output\freq-backward-analysis.txt    
    d
  
  
Parameters to the application:
  1. The frequency file to use
  2. The input file path
  3. Path to where output is written
  4. Whether we are encoding or decoding, 
     Abbreviations can be used
  5. Path where analysis of Huffman Tree is written
  6. (Optional) 
     What tie-break rule to use: "default" or "mirror"
     Abbreviations can be used

     
*** Several batch files included for convenience in dev ***

NOTE  
  Processing really big files may take a long time
  I have successfully encoded files up to 1000 lines
  Files larger than that might work, but they have not been tested
