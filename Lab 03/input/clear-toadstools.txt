The Spurned Harvest

     "_Whole hundred-weights of rich, wholesome diet rotting under
     the trees; woods teeming with food and not one hand to gather
     it; and this, perhaps, in the midst of poverty and all manner of
     privations and public prayers against imminent famine._"

Introduction

A prominent botanical authority connected with one of our universities,
upon learning of my intention of perpetrating a popular work on our
edible mushrooms and toadstools, was inclined to take issue with me
on the wisdom of such publication, giving as his reasons that, owing
to the extreme difficulty of imparting exact scientific knowledge
to the "general reader," such a work, in its presumably imperfect
interpretation by the very individuals it is intended to benefit, would
only result, in many instances, in supplanting the popular wholesome
distrust of all mushrooms with a rash over-confidence which would tend
to increase the labors of the family physician and the coroner. And, to
a certain extent, in its appreciation of the difficulty of imparting
exact science to the lay mind, his criticism was entirely reasonable,
and would certainly apply to any treatise on edible mushrooms for
popular circulation which contemplated a too extensive field, involving
subtle botanical analysis and nice differentiation between species.

[Sidenote: =Identification of fatal species=]

But when we realize the fact--now generally conceded--that most of the
fatalities consequent upon mushroom-eating are directly traceable to
one particular tempting group of fungi, and that this group is moreover
so distinctly marked that a _tyro_ could _learn_ to distinguish it,
might not such a popular work, in its emphasis by careful portraiture
and pictorial analysis of this deadly genus--placarding it so clearly
and unmistakably as to make it readily recognizable--might not such a
work, to that extent at least, accomplish a public service?

[Sidenote: =Conservative mycology=]

Moreover, even the most conservative mycologist will certainly admit
that out of the hundred and fifty of our admittedly esculent species
of fungi there might be segregated a few which bear such conspicuous
characters of outward form and other unique individual features--such
as color of spores, gills, and tubes, taste, odor, surface character,
color of milky juice, etc.--as to render them easily recognizable even
by the "general reader."

It is in the positive, affirmative assumption of these premises that
the present work is prepared, comprising as it does a selection of a
score or more, as it were, self-placarded esculent species of fungi,
while putting the reader safely on guard against the fatal species and
a few other more or less poisonous or suspicious varieties which remote
possibility might confound with them.

[Sidenote: =Popular interest in mushrooms=]

Since the publication of a recent magazine article on this topic, and
which became the basis of the present elaboration, I have been favored
with a numerous and almost continuous correspondence upon mushrooms,
including letters from every State in the Union, to say nothing of
Canada and New Mexico, evincing the wide-spread interest in the fungus
from the gustatory point of view. The cautious tone of most of these
letters, in the main from neophyte mycologists, is gratifying in its
demonstration of the wisdom of my position in this volume, or, as one
of my correspondents puts it, "the frightening of one to death at the
outset while extending an invitation to the feast." "Death was often
a consequence of toadstool eating," my friend continued, "but I never
before realized that it was a _certain_ result with _any_ particular
mushroom, and to the extent of this information I am profoundly
thankful."

[Sidenote: =Caution at the threshold=]

While, then, from the point of view of desired popularity of my book,
the grim greeting of a death's-head upon the frontispiece might be
considered as something of a handicap, the author confesses that this
attitude is the result of "malice prepense" and deliberation, realizing
that he is not offering to the "lay public," for mere intellectual
profit, this scientific analysis of certain fungus species. Were this
alone the _raison d'être_ or the logical outcome of the work--mere
_identification_ of edible and poisonous species--the grewsome symbol
which is so conspicuous on two of my pages might have been spared. But
when it is remembered that with the selected list of esculent mushrooms
herein offered is implied also an invitation and a recommendation to
the feast thereof, with the author as the host--that the digestive
functions of his confiding friends or guests are to be made the final
arbiters of the correctness of his botanical identification--the ban
of bane may as well be pronounced at the threshold. Let the too eager
epicurean be "scared to death at the outset," on the general principle
_pro bono publico_, and to the conciliation of the author's conscience.

[Sidenote: =To correspondents=]

The oft-repeated queries of other correspondents suggest the wisdom
of a clearer definition of the limitations of the present work.
Several individuals have written in surprise of their discovery of
a new toadstool which I "did not include in my pictured magazine
list," with accompaniment of more or less inadequate description and
somewhat enigmatical sketches, and desiring the name of the species
and judgment upon its esculent qualities. Such correspondence is a
pleasing tribute to an author, and is herewith gratefully acknowledged
as to the past and, with some mental reservations, welcomed as to the
future. The number of these communications--occasionally several in
a day, and with consequent rapid accumulation--renders it absolutely
impossible for a busy man to give them the prompt personal attention
which courtesy would dictate. My "mushroom" pigeon-hole, therefore, is
still plethoric with the unhonored correspondence of many weeks; and
inasmuch as the continual accession more than balances the number of
my responses, a fulfilment of my obligations in this direction seems
hopeless in contemplation. I would therefore beg the indulgence of
such of my friends as have awaited in vain for my reply to their kind
communications, even though the future should bring no tidings from me.
All of these letters have been received, and are herewith acknowledged:
many of them, too, if I may be pardoned what would seem to be a most
ungracious comment, for which the "dead-letter" office would have been
the more appropriate destination.

[Sidenote: =Consider the recipient=]

I refer to the correspondence "with accompanying specimens," the letter
occasionally enclosed in the same box with the said specimens, which,
upon its arrival, arouses a protest from the local postal authorities,
and calls for a liberal use of disinfectants--a disreputable-looking
parcel, which, indeed, would appear more consistently referable to the
health-board than to the mycologist. So frequent did this embarrassing
episode become that it finally necessitated the establishment of a
morgue for the benefit of my mushroom correspondents, or rather for
their "specimens," usually accompanied with the queries, "What is
the name of this mushroom? Is it edible?" I have been obliged to
write to several of my friends that identification of the remains was
impossible, that the remnant was more interesting entomologically than
botanically, and begging that in the future all such similar tokens
shall be forwarded in alcohol or packed in ice.

[Sidenote: =Rapid decay=]

"First impressions are lasting" and "a word to the wise is sufficient."
I would suggest that correspondents hereafter consider the hazard of
an introduction under such questionable auspices. Most species of
mushrooms are extremely perishable, and their "animal" character,
chemically considered, and their tendency to rapid decomposition,
render them unfit for transportation for any distance, unless
hermetically sealed, or their decay otherwise anticipated.

In the possibility of a continuance of this correspondence, consequent
upon the publication of this present book, the writer, in order to
forefend a presumably generous proportion of such correspondence,
would here emphasize the fact that he is by no means the authority on
mycology, or the science of fungi, which the attitude of his inquiring
friends would imply. Indeed, his knowledge of species is quite limited.
An early fascination, it is true, was humored with considerable zeal
to the accumulation of a portfolio of water-colors and other drawings
of various fungi--microscopic, curious, edible, and poisonous--and
this collection has been subsequently added to at intervals during his
regular professional work.

More than one of the originals of the accompanying colored plates have
been hidden in this portfolio for over twenty years, and a larger
number for ten or fifteen years, awaiting the further accumulation
of that knowledge and experience, especially with reference to the
edibility of species, which should warrant the utterance of the
long-contemplated book.

[Sidenote: =Number of mushroom species=]

The reader will therefore kindly remember that out of the approximate
1000 odd species of fungi entitled by their dimensions to the dignity
of "toadstools" or "mushrooms"--after separating the 2000 moulds,
mildews, rusts, smuts, blights, yeasts, "mother," and other microscopic
species--and out of the 150 recommended edible species, the present
work includes only about thirty. This selection has _direct reference
to popular utility_, only such species having been included as offer
some striking or other individual peculiarity by which they may be
simply identified, even without so-called scientific knowledge.

The addition of color to the present list enables its extension
somewhat beyond the scope of a series printed only in black and white,
as in the distinction of mere form alone an uncolored drawing of a
certain species might serve to the popular eye as a common portrait of
a number of allied species, possibly including a poisonous variety.

[Sidenote: =Mycology and mycophagy=]

[Sidenote: =Need of a practical work=]

While the study of "fungi" has a host of devotees, the mysteries which
involve the origin of life in this great order of the _cryptogamia_
having had fascinating attractions to microscopical students and
specialists, the study of _economic mycology_ has been almost without
a champion in the United States. Thus we have many learned treatises
on the nature, structure, and habits of fungi--vegetative methods,
chemical constituents, specific characters, classification--learned
dissertations on the microscopical moulds, mildews, rusts and smuts,
blights and ferments, to say nothing of the medico-scientific and
awe-inspiring potentialities of the sensational microbe, bacterium,
bacillus, etc., which are daily bringing humanity within their spell
and revolutionizing the science of medicine. But among all the various
mycological publications we look in vain for the great desideratum of
the practical hand-book on the _economic_ fungus--the _mushroom as
food_! The mycologist who has been courageous enough to submit his
chemical analysis and his botanical knowledge of fungi to the test
of esculence in his own being is a _rara avis_ among them; indeed, a
well-known authority states that "one may number on the fingers of
his two hands the entire list of mycophagists in the United States."
The absence of such works upon the mushroom and "toadstool," greatly
desired for reference at an early period of my career, and little
better supplied to-day, led to a resolve of which this volume is but an
imperfect fulfilment.

[Sidenote: =Limitations of this volume=]

The special character of my volume, then--the collateral consideration
of the fungus as food--will be sufficient excuse for the omission of
a merely technical discourse upon the structure, classification, and
vegetation of fungi as a class--a field so fully covered by other
authors more competent to discuss these lines of special science,
and to a selection of whose works the reader is referred in the list
herewith appended, to a number of which I am indebted for occasional
quotations. A general idea of the methods of dissemination and habitats
of fungi will be found in the final chapter on "spore-prints," while
under the discussion of the "Amanita," _Agaricus campestris_, and
the "Fairy Ring" the reader is referred to a condensed account of
the methods of vegetation and growth of fungi sufficient for present
purposes. Other references of similar character will be noted under
"Fungi," in Index.

[Sidenote: =The pioneer American mycophagist=]

The most conspicuous disciple of mycophagy--almost the pioneer, indeed,
in America--was the late Rev. M. A. Curtis, of North Carolina, whose
name heads the bibliography on page 325. For the benefit of those of my
readers who may wish to follow the subject further than my pages will
lead them, I append the list of edible species of fungi contained in
Curtis's Catalogue, each group alphabetically arranged, the esculent
qualities of many of which he himself discovered and attested by
personal experiment. The favorite habitat of each fungus is also given,
and to avoid any possibility of confusion in scientific nomenclature or
synonymes, the authority for the scientific name is also given in each
instance:

In the contemplation of such a generous natural larder as the above
list implies, Dr. Badham's feeling allusion to the "hundred-weights of
wholesome diet rotting under the trees," quoted in one of my earlier
illustrated pages, will be readily appreciated.

[Sidenote: =Restricted scope of this volume=]

In the purposely restricted scope of these pages I have omitted a large
majority of species in Dr. Curtis's list, known to be equally esculent
with those which I have selected, but whose _popular differentiation_
might involve too close discrimination and possibly serious error; and
while my list is probably not as complete as it might be with perfect
safety, the number embraces species, nearly all of them what may be
called cosmopolitan types, to be found more or less commonly throughout
the whole United States and generally identical with European species.
It will be observed that the list of Dr. Curtis is headed by three
members of Amanitæ. The particular species cited are well known to
be esculent, but they are purposely omitted from my list, which for
considerations of safety absolutely excludes the entire genus _Amanita_
of the "_poison-cup_" which is discussed at some length in the
succeeding chapter.

For popular utility from the food standpoint my selection presents,
to all intents and purposes, a more than sufficient list, the species
being easily distinguished, and, with proper consideration to their
freshness, entirely safe and of sufficient frequency in their haunts to
insure a continually available mushroom harvest throughout the entire
fungus season.

[Sidenote: =Fungus food always available=]

The knowledge of their identities once acquired, it is perfectly
reasonable to assert that in average weather conditions the
fungus-hunter may confine himself to these varieties and still be
confronted with an embarrassment of riches, availing himself of
three meals a day, with the mere trouble of a ramble through the
woods or pastures. Indeed, he may restrict himself to six of these
species--the green Russula, Puff-ball, Pasture-mushroom, Campestris
(meadow-mushroom), Shaggy-mane, and _Boletus edulis_--and yet become a
veritable mycological gourmand if he chooses, never at a loss for an
appetizing entrée at his table.

In the group of Russulæ and Boleti alone, more than one conservative
amateur of the writer's acquaintance finds a sufficient supply to meet
all dietary wants.

[Sidenote: =A neglected harvest=]

What a plenteous, spontaneous harvest of delicious feasting annually
goes begging in our woods and fields!

The sentiment of Dr. Badham, the eminent British authority on
mushrooms, years ago, in reference to the spontaneous perennial harvest
of wild edible fungi which abounded in his country, going to waste by
the ton, would appear to be as true to-day for Britain as when he
uttered it, and applies with even greater force to the similar, I may
say identical, neglected tribute of Nature in our own American woods
and fields, where the growth of fungi is especially rich.

[Sidenote: =Fungus epicures=]

The fungus-eaters of Britain, it is said, are even to-day merely
a conspicuous coterie, while in America this particular sort of
specialist is more generally an isolated "crank" who is compelled to
"flock alone," contemplated with a certain awe by his less venturesome
fellows, and otherwise variously considered, either with envy of
his experience and scientific knowledge, or more probably as an
irresponsible, who continually tempts Providence in his foolhardy
experiments with poison.

[Sidenote: =Chemical constituents=]

But what a contrast do we find on the Continent in the appreciation
of the fungus as an article of diet! In France, Germany, Russia, and
Italy, for example, where the woods are scoured for the perennial crop,
and where, through centuries of popular familiarity and tradition,
the knowledge of its economic value has become the possession of the
people, a most important possession to the poor peasant who, perhaps
for weeks together, will taste no other animal food. I say "animal
food" advisedly; for, gastronomically and chemically considered, the
flesh of the mushroom has been proven to be almost identical with meat,
and possesses the same nourishing properties. This animal affinity
is further suggested in its physiological life, the fungus reversing
the order of all other vegetation in imbibing oxygen and exhaling
carbonic acid, after the manner of animals. It is not surprising,
therefore, that the analogy should be still further emphasized by
the discrimination of the palate, many kinds of fungi when cooked
simulating the taste and consistency of animal food almost to the point
of deception.

[Sidenote: =Popular distrust of fungi=]

But in America the fungus is under the ban, its great majority of
harmless or even wholesome edible species having been brought into
popular disrepute through the contamination, mostly, of a single small
genus.

In the absence of special scientific knowledge, or, from our present
point of view, its equivalent, popular familiarity, this general
distrust of the whole fungus tribe may be, however, considered a
beneficent prejudice. So deadly is the insidious, mysterious foe that
lurks among the friendly species that it is well for humanity in
general that the entire list of fungi should share its odium, else
those "toadstool" fatalities, already alarmingly frequent, might become
a serious feature in our tables of mortality.

[Sidenote: =Fungus food for all=]

But the prejudice is needlessly sweeping. A little so-called knowledge
of fungi has often proven to be a "dangerous thing," it is true, but
it is quite possible for any one of ordinary intelligence, rightly
instructed, to master the discrimination of at least a _few_ of the
more _common edible_ species, while being _thoroughly equipped_
against the dangers of _deadly_ varieties, whose identification is
comparatively simple.

[Sidenote: ="Toadstool" and "mushroom"=]

It is idle to attempt an adjudication of the vexed "toadstool"
and "mushroom" question here. The toad is plainly the only final,
appealable authority on this subject. It may be questioned whether he
is at pains to determine the delectable or noisome qualities--from the
human standpoint--of a particular fungus before deciding to settle his
comfortable proportions upon its summit--if, indeed, he even so honors
even the humblest of them.

The oft-repeated question, therefore, "Is this fungus a toadstool or a
mushroom?" may fittingly be met by the counter query, "Is this rose a
flower or a blossom?"

The so-called distinction is a purely arbitrary, popular prejudice
which differentiates the "toadstool" as poisonous, the "mushroom" being
considered harmless. But even the rustic authorities are rather mixed
on the subject, as may be well illustrated by a recent incident in my
own experience.

[Sidenote: =Popular discrimination=]

Walking in the woods with a country friend in quest of fungi, we
were discussing this "toadstool" topic when we came upon a cluster
of mushrooms at the base of a tree-trunk, their broad, expanded caps
apparently upholstered in fawn-colored, undressed kid, their under
surfaces being stuffed and tufted in pale greenish hue.

"What would you call those?" I inquired.

"Those are toadstools, unmistakably," he replied.

"Well, toadstools or not, you see there about two pounds of
delicious vegetable meat, for it is the common species of edible
boletus--_Boletus edulis_."

A few moments later we paused before a beautiful specimen, lifting its
parasol of pure white above the black leaf mould.

"And what is this?" I inquired.

"I would certainly call _that_ a mushroom," was his instant reply.

This mushroom proved to be a fine, tempting specimen of the _Agaricus_
(_amanita_) _vernus_, the deadliest of the mushrooms, and one of the
most violent and fatal of all known vegetable poisons, whose attractive
graces and insidious wiles are doubtless continually responsible for
those numerous fatalities usually dismissed with the epitaph, "Died
from eating toadstools in mistake for mushrooms."

So much, therefore, for the popular distinction which makes "toadstool"
a synonyme for "poisonous," and "mushroom" synonymous with "edible,"
and which often proves to be the "little knowledge" which is very
dangerous.

[Sidenote: =The rustic authorities on "mushrooms"=]

The too prevalent mortality traceable to the mushroom is confined to
two classes of unfortunates: 1. Those who have not learned that there
is such a thing as a fatal mushroom; 2. The provincial authority who
Can "tell a mushroom" by a number of his so-called infallible "_tests_"
or "proofs." There is a large third class to whose conservative
caution is to be referred the prevalent arbitrary distinction between
"toadstool" and "mushroom," ardent disciples of old Tertullian, who
believed in regard to toadstools that "For every different hue they
display there is a pain to correspond to it, and just so many modes of
death as there are distinct species," and whose obstinate dogma, "There
is only one mushroom, all the rest are toadstools," has doubtless
spared them an occasional untimely grave, for few of this class, from
their very conservatism, ever fall victims to the "toadstool."

And what a self-complacent, patronizing, solicitous character this
rustic mushroom oracle is! Go where you will in the rural districts
and you are sure of him, or perhaps her--usually a conspicuous figure
in the neighborhood, the village blacksmith, perhaps, or the simpler
"Old Aunt Huldy." Their father and "granther" before them "knew how to
tell a mushroom," and this enviable knowledge has been their particular
inheritance.

How well we more special students of the fungus know him! and how he
wins our tender regard with his keen solicitude for our well-being!
We meet him everywhere in our travels, and always with the same old
story! We emerge from the wood, perhaps, with our basket brimful of our
particular fungus tidbits, topped off with specimens of red Russula
and Boletus, and chance to pass him on the road or in the meadow. He
scans the basket curiously as he passes us. He has perhaps heard rumors
afloat that "there's a city chap in town who is tempting Providence
with his foolin' with tudstools;" and with genuine solicitude and
superior condescension and awe, all betrayed in his countenance, he
must needs pause in his walk to relieve his mind in our behalf. I
recall one characteristic episode, of which the above is the prelude.

"Ye ain't a-goin' to eat _them_, air ye?" he asks, anxiously, by way of
introduction.

[Sidenote: =Rustic discrimination=]

"I am, most certainly," I respond; "that is, if I can get my good
farmer's wife to cook them without coming them and inundating them in
lemon-juice."

"Waal, then, I'll say good-bye to ye," he responds, with emphasis.
"Why, don't ye know them's tudstools, 'n' they'll _kill_ ye as _sartin_
as _pizen_? I wonder they ain't fetched ye afore this. You never larned
tew tell mushrooms. My father et 'em all his life, and so hev I, 'n' I
_know_ 'em. Come up into my garden yender 'n' I'll show ye haow to tell
the _reel mushroom_. There's a lot of 'em thar in the hot-bed naow.
Come along. I'll _give_ ye a mess on 'em if ye'll only throw them pizen
things away."

"And how do you know that those in your garden _are_ real mushrooms?" I
inquire.

"Why, they ain't _anything_ like _them_ o' yourn. They're pink and
black underneath, and peel up from the edge."

"How many kinds of mushrooms are there, do you suppose?" I ask.

"They's only the _one_ kind; all the others is _tudstools_ and _pizen_.
It's easy to tell the _reel_ mushroom. Come up and I'll show ye. Don't
eat _them_ things, I beg on ye! I vaow they'll _kill_ ye!"

At this point he catches a glimpse of a Shaggy-mane mushroom, which
comes to light as I tenderly fondle the specimens, and which is
evidently recognized as an acquaintance.

"What!" he exclaims, in pale alarm. "Ye _ain't_ goin' t' eat them
_too_?"

"Oh yes I am, this very evening," I respond. "I think I'll try them
_first_."

[Sidenote: =A rustic authority= ]

"Why, man, yure crazy! You don't know nothin' about 'em. I'd as soon
think o' eatin' pizen outright. Them's what we call black-slime
tudstools. They come up out o' manure. I've seen my muck-heap in my
barnyard covered with the nasty things time 'n' ag'in. They look nice
'n' white naow, but they rot into the onsiteliest black mess ye ever
see. I know wut I'm sayin'. Ye can't tell me nothin' 'baout _them_
tudstools! They keep comin' up along my barn-fence all thro' the
fall--_bushels_ of 'em."

"Well, my good friend, it's a great pity, then, that you have not
learned something about toadstools as well as mushrooms, for you might
have saved many a butcher's bill, and may in the future if you will
only take my word that this much-abused specimen is as truly a mushroom
as your pink-gilled peeler, and to my mind far more delicious."

"What! Do you mean to tell me thet you have _reely eaten 'em_?"

"Yes, indeed; often. Why, just look at its clean, shaggy cap, its
creamy white or pink gills underneath; take a sniff of its pleasant
aroma; and here! just taste a little piece--it's as sweet as a nut!" I
conclude, offering him the white morsel.

"Not much! I'll make my will first, thank'ee! You let me _see_ ye eat a
mess of 'em, and if the coroner don't get ye, p'r'aps I'll try on't."

[Sidenote: ="Toadstool" prejudice=]

Experiences similar to this one are frequent in the career of every
mycophagist, and serve to illustrate the pity and solicitude which
he awakens among his fellow-mortals, as well as to emphasize the
prevalent superstitions regarding the comparative virtues of the
mushroom and toadstool--a prejudice which, by-the-way, in the absence
of available popular literature on the subject, and the actual dangers
which encompass their popular distinction, is a most beneficent public
safeguard.

[Sidenote: =Popular tests and superstitions=]

The mushroom which "he can tell" is generally the _Agaricus
campestris_, or one of its several varieties; and knowing this alone,
and tempted by no other, this sort of village oracle escapes the fate
which often awaits another class, who are not thus conservative,
and who extend their definition of mushroom (a word supposed to be
synonymous with "edible"), and this mainly through the indorsement
of certain so-called infallible tests handed down to them from their
forefathers, and by which the esculent varieties may be distinguished
from the poisonous. By these so-called "tests" or "proofs" the
identification of certain species is gradually acquired. The rural
fungus epicure now "knows them by sight," or perhaps has received his
information second-hand, and makes his selection without hesitation,
with what success may be judged from the incident in my own experience
already noted--one which, knowing as I did the frequency and confidence
with which my country friend sampled the fungi at his table, filled me
with consternation and anxiety for his future.

"How, then, shall we distinguish a mushroom from a toadstool?"

There is no way of distinguishing them, for they are the same.

"How, then, shall we know a poisonous toadstool from a harmless one?"
the reader hopelessly exclaims.

This discrimination is by no means as difficult as is popularly
supposed, but in the first place, the student must entirely rid himself
of all preconceived notions and traditions, such as the following
almost world-wide "tests," many of which are easily demonstrated to be
worse than worthless, and have doubtless frequently led to an untimely
funeral. Some of these are merely local, and in widely separated
districts are supplanted by others equally arbitrary and absurd, while
many of them are as old as history.


  WORTHLESS TRADITIONAL TESTS FOR THE DISCRIMINATION
          OF POISONOUS AND EDIBLE MUSHROOMS

                   FAVORABLE SIGNS

    1. Pleasant taste and odor.
    2. Peeling of the skin of the cap from rim to centre.
    3. Pink gills, turning brown in older specimens.
    4. The stem easily pulled out of the cap and inserted in it
  like a parasol handle.
    5. Solid stems.
    6. Must be gathered in the morning.
    7. "Any fungus having a pleasant taste and odor, being found
  similarly agreeable after being plainly broiled without the
  least seasoning, is perfectly safe."

                  UNFAVORABLE SIGNS

    8. Boiling with a "silver spoon," the staining of the silver
  indicating danger.
    9. Change of color in the fracture of the fresh mushroom.
   10. Slimy or sticky on the top.
   11. Having the stems at their sides.
   12. Growing in clusters.
   13. Found in dark, damp places.
   14. Growing on wood, decayed logs, or stumps.
   15. Growing on or near manure.
   16. Having bright colors.
   17. Containing milky juice.
   18. Having the gill plates of even length.
   19. Melting into black fluid.
   20. Biting the tongue or having a bitter or nauseating taste.
   21. Changing color by immersion in salt-water, or upon being
  dusted with salt.

These present but a selection of the more prevalent notions. Taken
_in toto_, they would prove entirely safe, as they would practically
exclude every species of mushroom or toadstool that grows. But as a
rule the village oracle bases his infallibility upon two or three
of the above "rules," and inasmuch as the entire list absolutely
_omits_ the _only_ one test by which danger is to be avoided, it is
a seven-days' wonder that the grewsome toadstool epitaph is not more
frequent.

[Sidenote: =Absolute worthlessness of above tests=]

I once knew an aged dame who was accepted as a village oracle on
this as well as other topics, such as divining, palmistry, and
fortune-telling, and who ate and dispensed toadstools on a few of
the above rules. Strange to say, she lived to a good old age, and
no increased mortality is credited to her memory as a result of her
generosity.

How are these popular notions sustained by the facts? Let us analyze
them seriatim and confront each with its refutation, the better to show
their entire untrustworthiness.


POPULAR TESTS REFUTED

[Sidenote: =Worthless popular tests=]

_Pleasant taste and odor_ (1) is a conspicuous feature in the regular
"mushroom" (_Agaricus campestris_), and most other edible fungi, but as
a criterion for safety it is a mockery. The deadly _Agaricus amanita_,
already mentioned, has an inviting odor and to most people a pleasant
taste when raw, and being cooked and eaten gives no token of its fatal
resources until from six to twelve hours after, when its unfortunate
victim is past hope. (See p. 68.)

The _ready peeling_ of the skin (2) is one of the most widely prevalent
proofs of probation, and is often considered a _sufficient_ test; yet
the Amanita will be found to peel with a degree of accommodation which
would thus at once settle its claims as a "mushroom." Indeed, a large
number of species, including several poisonous kinds, will peel as
perfectly as the Campestris.

_The pink gills turning brown_(3) is a marked characteristic of the
"mushroom" (_A. campestris_, Plate 5), and, being a rare tint among
the fungus tribe, is really one of the most valuable of the tests,
especially as it is limited by rules affecting other pink-gilled
species.

_The stem being easily pulled out of the cap_ (4) applies to several
edible species, but equally to the poisonous.

[Sidenote: =Worthless popular tests=]

The notion that _edible mushrooms have solid stems_ (5) would be a
very unsafe talisman for us to take to the woods in our search for
fungus-food. Many poisonous species are thus solid--the emetic Russula,
for example--while the alleged importance of the =morning specimens=
(6) is without the slightest foundation.

The passage quoted here (7), or a statement to the same effect, was
quite widely circulated in the newspapers a dozen or more years ago, in
an article which bore all the indications of authoritative utterance,
the assumption being that the poisonous mushroom would invariably give
some forbidding token to the senses by which it might be discriminated.

Woe to the fungus epicure who should sample his mushrooms and
toadstools on such a criterion as this, as the _most fatal of all
mushrooms_, the _Amanita vernus_, would fulfil all these requisites.

_The discoloration of silver_ (8) is a test as old as Pliny at least,
a world-wide popular touchstone for the detection of deleterious
fungi, but useful only in the fact that it will often exclude a poison
not contemplated in the discrimination. On this point, especially as
it affords opportunity to emphasize a common disappointment of the
mushroom-eater, I quote from a recent work by Julius A. Palmer (see
Bibliography, No. 3): "Mushrooms decay very rapidly. In a short time a
fair, solid fungus becomes a mass of maggots which eat its tissue until
its substance is honey-combed; these cells, on a warm day, are charged
with the vapors of decomposition. Now you put such mushrooms as these
(and I have seen just such on the markets of Boston and London) over
the fire. In boiling, sulphuretted hydrogen or other noxious gases are
liberated; you stir with a bright spoon and it is discolored; proud of
your test, you throw away your stew. Now this is right, but if from
this you conclude that all fungus which discolors silver is poisonous
and that which leaves it bright is esculent, you are in dangerous
error. It is the same with fish at sea. Tradition says that you must
fry a piece of silver with them and throw them away if it discolors.
Certainly the experiment does no harm, and shows a decomposition in
both cases which might have been detected without the charm." Opposed
to this so-called talisman, how grim is the fact that the deadliest of
all mushrooms, the Amanita, in its fresh condition, has no effect upon
silver.
