Lab 02: "Towers of Hanoi"
April 3, 2018

This application creates a "cheatsheet" that gives
move-by-move instructions to solve the "Towers of Hanoi"
puzzle for a given number of disks.  The "cheatsheet"
gives an optimal solution, i.e. a solution with the
fewest possible number of moves.

Please see the PDF file in the project directory, LabTowersOfHanoiRev.pdf, 
for detail about the lab assignment.  And the .DOCX file for analysis.

Output of "java -version" on the DEV machine

  java version "1.8.0_161"
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_161-b12)
  Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.161-b12, mixed mode, sharing)

This version of Java is also known as "Java 8.0 SE"


No IDE was used; this code was written in Notepad++ and 
compiled from the command line.

For an example of how to compile, please see "rebuild.bat".

  @echo off
  javac src\*.java

For an example of how to run, see "test.bat", or follow this code

  java -cp src\ Lab02 10 "output\tower-10r.txt" 1  
  java -cp src\ Lab02 8 "output\tower-10i.txt" 0 "time.txt"
  
Parameters to the application:
  1. The number of disks in the puzzle
  2. The file where output is written
  3. What mode to use, "0" for iterative, "1" for recursive
  4. (Optional) where to put the execution time, with other 
       identifying info
     If not provided output/timings.txt will be used
     
*** Other BAT files also included: ***

  test.bat
    Takes parameters 1 and 3 only, default output file name used
  
  run-iterative.bat
    Takes one parameter, M, runs iterative method for 1 to M,
      saving files to a default file name
      
  run-recursive.bat
    Similar to run-iterative, but uses recursive method
  
  compare-with-git.bat
    Compares the i and r files, assuming the default name,
    using git diff --no-index
    Allows for easy inspection that the instruction lists
    are the same between the two methods
